# Classify-Time-series-Signals-by-Conv1D

financial markets are complex and dynamical, so many participants with individual actions, and actions affect the market trend, the trend changes behaviours of participants

making prediction of the market trend has a long history, using traditional technical analysis methods (macd, csi, etc) , using such indicator to help investor to make decision

inspired by the success of the ML in so many area (image classification, robot control, etc), using ML/DL to solve the prediction problem of the financial market becomes a brilllant way, SVM, KNN, Tree, and now neural networks

financial data is mainly composed of time serie signal, just like ECG, using conventional pattens recongnition methods can help people to classify the signal

Applying rnn cell (LSTM) convolution cell (conv1d) to time serie signal processing, has many successful examples
